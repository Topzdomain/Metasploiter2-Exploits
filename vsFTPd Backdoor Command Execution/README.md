Back Door Execution Command Exploit of FTP Service vsFTPd Version. 

Based on an Nmap scan of the target machine, it was observed that a vsftpd 2.3.4 version of the FTP service was open on port 21, which is the port number for FTP service. On further scan of the vsftpd version of FTP, using Metasploit, it was observed that access can be gained into the machine using the back door command execution exploit.

```commandline
search vsftpd
```

</p>

So I used 1 which is the numerical value for back door execution command and typed in options to show some of the key requirement that I can provide for the exploit to be successful. One key requirement that needs to be provided is the remote host (Rhosts) of the vulnerable machine. So I provided the Rhosts which is the ip address of the vulnerable machine (Metasploiter2). 

```commandline
msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set rhosts 10.0.200.5
rhosts => 10.0.200.5
msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > exploit
```

</p>

I was able to gain access into the metasploiter2 and browse the files on the machine

What I learned:

- how to exploit a vulnerable ftp service
- use of Nmap to scan machine for vulnerability
- Made use of Metasploit to initiate an exploit
- more knowledge on the use of Kali Linux
