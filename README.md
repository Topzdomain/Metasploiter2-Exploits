The Metasploiter2 is a virtual machine that is intentionally designed to be a vulnerable machine that can be used to conduct security training, test security tools, and practice common penetration testing techniques. An Nmap scan of the Machine was carried out to reveal all the open ports and vulnerable services running on the machine and the result written to MS2X.txt on the current directory.

```commandline
nmap -p- -sV 192.168.43.152 -oN MS2X.txt
```
