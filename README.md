The Metasploiter2 is a virtual machine that is intentionally designed to be a vulnerable machine that can be used to conduct security training, test security tools, and practice common penetration testing techniques. An Nmap scan of the metasploiter2 machine was carried out to reveal all the open ports and vulnerable services running on the machine and the result written to a text file named MS2X.txt on the current directory. After the scan, I began exploiting the various vulnerable services that were running on the open ports. Prior to this, I had set-up a Virtual Box and installed Kali Linux and the Metasploiter2. The network set-up on the Virtual Box is NAT Networks. This ensures that every machine connected to that Network are assigned private ip addresses while they share one public ip address, with their communication to external networks (Internet) translated to the public ip address.

```commandline
nmap -p- -sV 192.168.43.152 -oN MS2X.txt
```
